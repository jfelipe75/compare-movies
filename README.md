# Compare-Movies

1. To start, we'll load up all our movies from localStorage and display them in a list (use a grid to display them).\*

- We're getting some default movies to start with in movie-data.json (lets copy it into our repo).To do this we're going to import our movie data directly from the browser into data-store.js. \*

- Now let us store these default movies we just imported from movie-data.json in our local storage. \*

- Create a movie section in index.html, give it a grid attribute in the style.css so that when we render our movies, they are instanly formated in a grid.\*

- Create rendering functions that retrieve current movie array from local storage and display each element in the array to our page.\*

2. Build a form that takes in the movie's title, genre, audience score, domestic, critic score. Each input on the form is required in the html. When a form is submitted the movie is added to the top of the list (TO DO !!!!!)
